## Project Features

### ReactJS Framework

**JSX Syntax**

JSX allows for a synthesis of HTML and Javascript, greatly reducing the amount of code necessary to complete a project.

**Hooks vs Classes**

The use of Hooks is the future of React, and best practice dictates replacing class structures with Hooks when possible.

### API Implementation

**Open Weather**

OpenWeather is an API that can return current weather data for a specified area. The data was utilized to create meaningful elements in the App.

### Dynamic Page Elements

**Weather Card Background**

The background of the weather card element changes depending on the time of day and weather conditions.

**Temperature Display**

The current temperature is displayed and logic has been included for displaying different temperature units in future versions.

### Future Development

**Customizable Temperature Units**

**API Implementation** to allow for added clothing item cards.

**Data Validation**
